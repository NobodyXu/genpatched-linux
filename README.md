# genpatched-linux

Linux kernel patched using [genpatch](https://dev.gentoo.org/~mpagano/genpatches/tarballs/) 
and my custom patch `patches/enable_poweroff_on_init_exit.patch`.

This branch has applied all patches in `patches/*` except for `patches/genpatches-base/1500_XATTR_USER_PREFIX.patch` and `patches/genpatches-experimental/5013_enable-cpu-optimizations-for-gcc10.patch`.
